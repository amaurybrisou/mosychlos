When data is available via these tools — `fred`, `yfinance_market_data`, `yfinance_stock_data`, `yfinance_financials`, `yfinance_dividends`, `fmp`, `fmp_analyst_estimates`, `news_api` — you MUST call them instead of generic web search. Cite the tool name inline with each insight. Only use web search if none of the above tools can provide the requested data.
