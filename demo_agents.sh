# Demo script for OpenAI Agents Go SDK integration with Mosychlos

echo "=== OpenAI Agents Go SDK Integration Demo ==="
echo ""

echo "This demo shows the integration of the OpenAI Agents Go SDK into Mosychlos."
echo "The integration provides agent-based analysis with handoff capabilities."
echo ""

echo "Available analysis modes:"
echo "1. Standard analysis (existing batch/sync engines)"
echo "2. Agent-based analysis with handoffs (NEW)"
echo ""

echo "=== Agent-based Analysis Features ==="
echo ""

echo "✓ BaseAgentEngine - Foundation for agent-based engines"
echo "  - Uses agents.Run() instead of direct LLM calls"
echo "  - Maintains SharedBag compatibility"
echo "  - Preserves existing Engine interface"
echo ""

echo "✓ AgentRiskEngine - Risk analysis with agent patterns"
echo "  - Comprehensive risk analysis prompts"
echo "  - Tool integration via ToolWrapper"
echo "  - Professional institutional analysis standards"
echo ""

echo "✓ AgentTriageEngine - Smart routing with handoffs"
echo "  - Routes analysis requests to specialist agents"
echo "  - Supports RiskSpecialist, AllocationSpecialist, etc."
echo "  - Enables complex multi-agent workflows"
echo ""

echo "✓ ToolWrapper - Seamless tool integration"
echo "  - Converts Mosychlos tools to agent tools"
echo "  - Maintains tool constraints and budget tracking"
echo "  - Bridge between existing and agent architectures"
echo ""

echo "=== Usage Examples ==="
echo ""

echo "# Use traditional engines (existing behavior)"
echo "./mosychlos analyze"
echo ""

echo "# Use batch processing engines"  
echo "./mosychlos analyze --batch"
echo ""

echo "# Use NEW agent-based engines with handoffs"
echo "./mosychlos analyze --agents"
echo ""

echo "=== Agent Architecture Benefits ==="
echo ""

echo "1. Agent Handoffs - Route complex requests to specialists"
echo "2. Multi-turn Analysis - Agents can iterate and refine"
echo "3. Tool Integration - Use all existing Mosychlos tools"
echo "4. Context Preservation - SharedBag maintains state"
echo "5. Flexible Workflows - Chain multiple agent interactions"
echo ""

echo "=== Integration Compatibility ==="
echo ""

echo "✓ Two-layer orchestrator→engines design preserved"
echo "✓ SharedBag context management maintained"
echo "✓ Tool constraints and budget tracking compatible" 
echo "✓ Existing CLI commands unchanged"
echo "✓ Gradual migration path available"
echo ""

echo "The agent integration provides a powerful new analysis paradigm while"
echo "maintaining full compatibility with existing Mosychlos architecture."
