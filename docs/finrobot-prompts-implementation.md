# FinRobot Prompt Engineering Guidelines for Mosychlos

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for implementing FinRobot's sophisticated financial analysis prompts in the Mosychlos Go project. FinRobot uses advanced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and specialized financial personas to deliver institutional-grade analysis.

## FinRobot Prompt Architecture

### **Chain-of-Thought Financial Analysis Pattern**

FinRobot employs structured financial reasoning that breaks down complex analysis into systematic steps:

```go
// internal/prompt/templates/financial_analysis.go
const IncomeStatementAnalysisPrompt = `
As a Senior Financial Analyst with 15+ years of experience analyzing public companies, conduct a comprehensive income statement analysis following this systematic approach:

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:

1. REVENUE ANALYSIS:
   - Examine total revenue trends over the past 3-5 years
   - Calculate year-over-year growth rates and identify trends
   - Analyze revenue mix by product/service lines if available
   - Compare revenue growth to industry benchmarks and peer companies
   - Assess revenue quality, seasonality, and cyclicality
   - Identify key revenue drivers and potential headwinds

2. GROSS PROFITABILITY ANALYSIS:
   - Calculate gross profit margins for each year
   - Analyze margin trends and identify expansion/contraction drivers
   - Assess cost of goods sold efficiency and supply chain impacts
   - Compare gross margins to industry standards and competitors
   - Evaluate pricing power and cost management effectiveness

3. OPERATING EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS:
   - Calculate operating margins and analyze trends
   - Break down operating expenses (SG&A, R&D, other)
   - Assess operational leverage and scalability
   - Analyze expense management discipline
   - Evaluate investment in growth initiatives (R&D, marketing)

4. PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS ANALYSIS:
   - Analyze net profit margins and bottom-line growth
   - Calculate return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE)
   - Assess earnings quality and sustainability
   - Identify one-time items and their impact on core earnings
   - Evaluate tax efficiency and effective tax rates

5. FORWARD-LOOKING ASSESSMENT:
   - Synthesize management guidance and strategic initiatives
   - Assess competitive positioning and market dynamics
   - Evaluate potential risks and opportunities
   - Provide investment thesis and key monitoring metrics

```go
// internal/prompt/generator.go
type PromptGenerator struct {
    manager   *PromptManager
    validator *DataValidator
}

func (pg *PromptGenerator) GenerateAnalysisPrompt(ctx context.Context, request *AnalysisRequest) (string, error) {
    // Validate required data
    err := pg.validator.ValidateData(request.PersonaType, request.AnalysisType, request.Data)
    if err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("data validation failed: %w", err)
    }

    // Get base persona prompt
    basePrompt, err := pg.manager.GetPersonaPrompt(
        request.PersonaType,
        request.AnalysisType,
        request.Data,
    )
    if err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("failed to get persona prompt: %w", err)
    }

    // Add market context
    if marketContext := request.Data["market_context"]; marketContext != nil {
        basePrompt = pg.addMarketContext(basePrompt, marketContext)
    }

    // Add sector-specific context

        prompts[member.PersonaType] = memberPrompt
    }

    return prompts, nil
}
```

## Integration with Multi-Persona Engine

### **Prompt-Persona Coordination**

```go
// internal/engine/multi_persona_engine.go (prompt integration)
func (e *MultiPersonaEngine) executeCommitteeWorkflow(ctx context.Context, input *EngineInput) (*EngineResult, error) {
    // Generate committee prompts
    committeeRequest := &CommitteeRequest{
        Data:    input.Data,
        Members: input.Committee.Members,
    }

    prompts, err := e.promptGenerator.GenerateCommitteePrompts(ctx, committeeRequest)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to generate committee prompts: %w", err)
    }

    // Execute committee discussion with specialized prompts
    results := make(map[string]*PersonaResult)

    // Chairperson initiates discussion
    chairpersonPrompt := prompts["chairperson"]
    chairpersonResult, err := e.executePersona(ctx, "Investment_Committee_Chairperson", chairpersonPrompt, input.Data)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("chairperson execution failed: %w", err)
    }
    results["chairperson"] = chairpersonResult

    // Committee members provide their analysis
    for _, member := range input.Committee.Members {
        memberPrompt := prompts[member.PersonaType]
        memberResult, err := e.executePersona(ctx, member.PersonaType, memberPrompt, input.Data)
        if err != nil {
            logger.Warn("Committee member execution failed",
                "persona", member.PersonaType,
                "error", err)
            continue
        }
        results[member.PersonaType] = memberResult
    }

    // Synthesize committee decision
    return e.synthesizeCommitteeDecision(ctx, results)
}
```

## Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques

### **Chain-of-Thought with Financial Reasoning**

```go
const FinancialReasoningCoTPrompt = `
Apply systematic financial reasoning using this step-by-step approach:

STEP 1: DATA INTERPRETATION
- What does the financial data tell us about the company's current state?
- Are there any data quality issues or one-time items to consider?
- How does this data compare to historical trends?

STEP 2: ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK APPLICATION
- Which financial ratios and metrics are most relevant for this analysis?
- What industry-specific factors should influence our interpretation?
- How do we weight quantitative vs. qualitative factors?

STEP 3: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
- How does this company compare to industry peers?
- What are the relevant benchmarks and how do we stack rank performance?
- Where does this company excel or lag relative to competition?

STEP 4: RISK ASSESSMENT
- What are the key business, financial, and market risks?
- How might these risks impact future performance?
- What are the probability-weighted downside scenarios?

STEP 5: FORWARD-LOOKING SYNTHESIS
- Based on this analysis, what is the investment thesis?
- What are the key catalysts and milestones to monitor?
- What is the risk-adjusted expected return and confidence level?

Walk through each step systematically, showing your reasoning process.
`
```

### **Prompt Validation and Quality Control**

```go
// internal/prompt/validator.go
type PromptValidator struct {
    qualityChecks []QualityCheck
    persona       map[string]PersonaConfig
}

type QualityCheck struct {
    Name        string
    Description string
    Validator   func(string) error
}

func (pv *PromptValidator) ValidatePrompt(personaName, prompt string) error {
    // Check prompt length
    if len(prompt) < 100 {
        return errors.New("prompt too short for meaningful analysis")
    }

    if len(prompt) > 8000 {
        return errors.New("prompt too long, may hit token limits")
    }

    // Check required persona elements
    persona := pv.persona[personaName]
    for _, requirement := range persona.RequiredData {
        if requirement.Required && !strings.Contains(prompt, requirement.Name) {
            return fmt.Errorf("prompt missing required data: %s", requirement.Name)
        }
    }

    // Check analysis framework coverage
    for _, step := range persona.AnalysisFramework {
        if step.Required && !pv.checkFrameworkCoverage(prompt, step) {
            return fmt.Errorf("prompt missing required analysis framework: %s", step.Name)
        }
    }

    return nil
}

func (pv *PromptValidator) checkFrameworkCoverage(prompt string, step AnalysisStep) bool {
    // Check if prompt contains elements of the required analysis step
    keywords := extractKeywords(step.Description)
    matchCount := 0

    for _, keyword := range keywords {
        if strings.Contains(strings.ToLower(prompt), strings.ToLower(keyword)) {
            matchCount++
        }
    }

    // Require at least 60% keyword coverage
    return float64(matchCount)/float64(len(keywords)) >= 0.6
}
```
