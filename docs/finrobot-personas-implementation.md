# FinRobot AI Agent Personas - Implementation Guide for Mosychlos

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive implementation guidelines for recreating FinRobot's sophisticated AI agent personas in Mosychlos. Based on analysis of FinRobot's `agent_library.py`, we detail the essential characteristics, responsibilities, and prompt patterns for each financial persona.

## FinRobot Agent Architecture Analysis

### **Core Agent Structure from FinRobot**

From FinRobot's codebase analysis, each agent persona follows this consistent structure:

```python
# From FinRobot agent_library.py
{
